# 🚀 LeetCode Practice – Problem List: [Pareto-Problems-List](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/niv5svl2/)

This repository contains my solutions to problems from a curated [LeetCode list (Pareto-Problems)](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/niv5svl2/). The goal is to develop strong problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of core Data Structures and Algorithms through consistent practice.

## 📌 About the Problem List

The [Pareto-Problem](https://leetcode.com/problem-list/niv5svl2/) list is a hand-picked set of LeetCode problems focused on:

- Arrays & Hashing
- Sliding Window & Two Pointers
- Stack & Queues
- Binary Search
- Heap
- Trees
- Graphs

These problems are ideal for strengthening fundamentals and preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies.

## 👨‍💻 Language Used

All solutions are implemented in **Java**.

## 🚧 Work in Progress
